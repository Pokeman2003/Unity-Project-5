Some stuff about the game:
Enemy types:
Recon - Jumpjet - Limited to light machine gun. Warns everyone. Works in tandem with rocketeers. Jumps across small gaps for a surprise attack. Can't fly. Fire in rapid bursts.
Rocketeer - Increased Fuel - Flies quite often. Immediately takes to the air to try to aerially bombard you if recon spots you. Doesn't check for fuel.
Blockadesman - Armor - Heavy duty, can even take a rocket to the face. Rather slow though.
Bombadier - Firepower Upgrade - Fires arcing rockets. Attempts to bombard from their position based on Recon intel. Fires in trios.
Rocketman - None. - Only rockets. Uses standard AI, with no special gimmicks.
Light - None. - Only machine gun. Uses standard AI, with no special gimmicks.
Medium - None. - Both rockets and machine gun. Uses standard AI, with no special gimmicks.

Powerup descriptions:
Jumpjet - Air control, increased speed in air, spends once and must recharge.
Increased Fuel - Triples your fuel and doubles the recharge time.
Armor - Doubles your health. Lets you sustain all but direct hits.
Firepower Upgrade - Lets you fire 4 rockets in rapid succession, before needing to do a lengthy reload.

Refills by current defaults:
Jumpjet:3.75 seconds.
Jetpack:40 seconds 
Jetpack(INCREASED):60 seconds.
Firepower:12 seconds.
